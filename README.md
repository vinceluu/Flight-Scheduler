# Flight-Scheduler
Project Description:
Flight scheduler which simulates a booking interface where the user can “book” a flight while taking into account of time constraints and availability. If all flight seats are taken, then the user will be placed on a wait list. If a flight gets cancelled, then all customers flights get cancelled. The database used in this project was Java DB. All files are were implemented with Java using NetBeans IDE.
